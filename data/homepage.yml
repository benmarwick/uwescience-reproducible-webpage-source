  title : "Our values, motivtion, and vision"
  content : "We value improvements in tools to support sharing and reproducibility, 
  the design of repositories for collecting reproducible experiments and observations, techniques to query and 
  analyze shared data, and workflows to facilitate re-use. 
  <br><br>
  Open science is closely related to 
  reproducibility, sharing needs in both technological and software advances as well as in 
  changes to the research culture. However, reproducible research need not be completely open 
  and there are cases where it will not be due to privacy issues, proprietary data, or reluctance 
  on the part of scientists to share software that has taken years to develop or data that was hard to acquire.
  <br><br>
  We are motivated by the view that reproducibility starts at the level of individual scientists 
  or groups of collaborators being able to reproduce and build upon their own work, 
  as well as to later verify its correctness if necessary. Our vision of open science to work towards 
  broader sharing that typically requires and facilitates reproducibility.
  <br><br>
  For implementing sustainable policy on reproducible science we are motivated by, and working from, the 
  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reports <a href='http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/brdi/open_science_enterprise/'>
  Open Science By Design: Realizing 
  a Vision for 21st Century Research</a> (2018), <a href=' https://doi.org/10.17226/25303'>Reproducibility and Replicability in Science</a> (2019)

      title : "'R and friends for better science in less time in big (and small) team collaborations', a seminar by Julia Stewart Lowndes (19 Nov 2019)"
      content : "R has demonstrable potential to accelerate scientific research, since it not only provides powerful analytical 
      'tools that increase reproducibility but also creates a new frontier for communication when combined with the open web. 
      But thus far, the power of R and friends have largely been harnessed by individuals; how do we harness this power as 
      teams in science, big and small? I will discuss how our <a href='http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/'>Ocean Health Index</a>
      team dramatically improved how we work by 
      creating an analytical workflow with R – and by peer-learning and peer-teaching the skillsets we needed on-the-job by 
      engaging with the broader <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=hashtag_click&f=live'>#rstats</a> and 
      <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openscience&src=hashtag_click&f=live'>#openscience</a> communities (Lowndes 
      et al. 2017; Nature Ecology & Evolution). I will
      also discuss Openscapes, which I developed as a Mozilla Fellow. <a href='https://openscapes.org'>Openscapes</a> is a
      mentorship program to engage and empower 
      science teams with open data science tools and practices (openscapes.org). With both the Ocean Health Index and Openscapes,
      my work aims to help catalyze the fundamental shift needed in scientific culture where we value and prioritize data 
      science, collaboration, and open practices, and provide training and support for our emerging scientific leaders – 
      not only as individuals, but as teams. <a href='https://jules32.github.io/'>Julia Stewart Lowndes Ph.D.</a>, is a marine ecologist, data scientist, and Mozilla 
      Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), USA. As founding director of Openscapes and 
      science program lead of the Ocean Health Index, and co-founder of Eco-Data-Science and R-Ladies Santa Barbara, she works 
      to increase the value and practice of environmental open data science. She earned her PhD at Stanford University in 2012 
      studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate.

      title : "'Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research: The Pedagogy of Reproducible Science in Undergraduate Education', a seminar by Richard Ball (29 Oct 2019)"
      content : "Richard Ball is the founder of Project TIER (https://www.projecttier.org/), and is here as a guest of the UW eScience Reproducible 
      Research Special Interest Group and the UW Center for Teaching and Learning. Many journals now require authors 
      to submit extensive public-facing documentation to support empirical 
      papers. In this talk, Professor Ball discusses teaching research transparency to students in quantitative 
      fields of study. <a href='https://www.projecttier.org/'>Project TIER</a> (Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research) integrates transparent and 
      reproducible research methods into instruction by developing standard protocols for conducting and 
      documenting statistical research. Enacting these protocols ensures that all reported results are computationally 
      reproducible and that the methods employed are immediately legible to other researchers. Professor Ball gives an 
      overview of the approaches to research reproducibility that Project TIER promotes, discusses the resulting 
      educational benefits, and considers lessons for professional research practice that emerge from using the 
      Project TIER system. He also identifies potential opportunities for collaboration between Project TIER 
      and UW faculty to promote transparency in education and research.

      title : "Teaching Undergraduates Reproducible Research: A Short Workshop for UW Instructors (19 Apr 2019)"
      content : "Teaching students integrity when doing empirical research is a high priority for instructors. 
      However, increases in the volume and variety of data means that our students face new challenges in 
      learning how to efficiently and transparently get insights from these data. In response to these 
      changes, we recognise that new approaches to teaching and learning are necessary to ensure our 
      students are equipped with methods and tools to produce credible science. To learn about these 
      new approaches, the UW eScience Institute is organising a short workshop on teaching undergraduates 
      reproducible and transparent research methods. The goal of the workshop is to share information about how 
      to teach reproducible and transparent research, especially in fields outside of computer science. 
      Doing reproducible and transparent research is increasingly becoming a priority in many research 
      communities, and we want UW undergraduates to get the best training on how to do this so they can 
      be at the forefront of their disciplines. We also want to foster a community of instructors who are 
      promoting open science practices on campus, following the recommendations of the National Academies’ 
      2018 report ‘Open Science by Design: Realizing a Vision for 21st Century Research’ (https://doi.org/10.17226/25116).

      title : "Launch of the UW Libraries' Research Guide on Reproducibility (2 Nov 2018)"
      content : "With the rapid growth of data science in academia and industry it can be challenging to navigate
      the numerous tutorials, blog posts, and other sources of information. It can also be hard to know which tools
      and methods are trustworthy and widely used. To help with this challenge, 
      <a href='http://guides.lib.uw.edu/prf.php?account_id=147033'>Liz Bedford</a> led the group to research and write an 
      authoritative official <a href='http://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/reproducibility'>Research Guide on Reproducibility</a>
      in research and teaching. Liz is the Scholarly Publishing Outreach Librarian with the UW Libraries, and her outstanding new guide is an excellent complement 
      to the UW Libraries' guides on <a href='http://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/dmg'>data management</a> and 
      <a href='http://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/spoa'>open access</a>."
